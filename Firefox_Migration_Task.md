# Task Description
The user wants to translate the Chrome extension project into a Firefox extension. This involves creating a new branch and making the necessary code modifications for Firefox compatibility.

# Project Overview
The project is a browser extension named "KMatch" that checks for visa sponsorship on LinkedIn and Indeed job listings. It consists of a manifest file, background scripts, content scripts, and UI components (popup).

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)
- **`manifest.json`**: Uses `"manifest_version": 3` and a `"background"` key with a `"service_worker"` entry, which is specific to Chrome. Firefox requires a `"scripts"` array within the `"background"` key. A `browser_specific_settings.gecko.id` is also required for Firefox.
- **`background.js`**: Uses `chrome.runtime.onInstalled` and `chrome.tabs.create`. These need to be converted to `browser.runtime.onInstalled` and `browser.tabs.create`.
- **`content.js`**: Uses `chrome.runtime.getURL` and `chrome.runtime.onMessage`. These need to be converted to their `browser.*` equivalents.
- **`popup.js`**: Uses `chrome.tabs.query` and `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` with callbacks. These should be updated to use the promise-based `browser.*` APIs with `async/await`.

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)
The chosen solution is **Native Refactoring**. This involves manually updating the manifest file and all JavaScript files to use Firefox-compatible `browser.*` APIs and modern promise-based syntax. This approach avoids adding external dependencies like polyfills and ensures better long-term maintainability for the Firefox version of the extension.

# Implementation Plan (Generated by PLAN mode)
Implementation Checklist:
1.  **Modify `manifest.json` for Firefox compatibility.**
    *   In the `background` object, replace the `service_worker` key with a `scripts` key, pointing to an array containing `background.js`.
    *   Add a `browser_specific_settings` key, which is required for the Firefox Add-on store, and include a gecko-specific ID for development.
2.  **Update `background.js` to use `browser.*` APIs.**
    *   Replace all `chrome.*` calls (`chrome.runtime.onInstalled`, `chrome.tabs.create`, `chrome.runtime.getURL`) with their `browser.*` equivalents.
3.  **Update `content.js` to use `browser.*` APIs.**
    *   Replace all `chrome.*` calls (`chrome.runtime.getURL`, `chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener`) with their `browser.*` equivalents.
4.  **Refactor `popup.js` for `browser.*` APIs and Promises.**
    *   Replace `chrome.tabs.query` with `await browser.tabs.query(...)`.
    *   Replace the `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` callback with an `async/await` call inside a `try...catch` block to handle errors properly.

# Final Review (Populated by REVIEW mode)
The implementation perfectly matches the final plan. All checklist items were completed correctly. The `manifest.json` file was updated for Firefox, and all JavaScript files (`background.js`, `content.js`, `popup.js`) were refactored to use the `browser.*` namespace and modern promise-based APIs. No unreported deviations were found. The extension is now ready for testing in Firefox.
